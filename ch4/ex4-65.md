```
(rule (wheel ?person)
    (and (supervisor ?middle-manager ?person)
        (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager)))
```

(wheel ?who)
-> first (supervisor ?middle-manager ?who) finds all supervisor pairs
-> second (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager) uses the first of all pairs as the second to search all pairs
-> because (B B) has 3 direct reports, (W O) matches three times. (H A P) has 1 direct report, so (B B) matches once
